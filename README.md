# ghoshCacheVerse
I developed CacheVerse, a team portfolio, using HTML and SASS for the Dell Startup Challenge, It was my initial timed project, showcasing our products, team members, and contact details. We progressed to the penultimate round and received an invitation to the Bangalore finals. The website depicted our aim and various projects.
